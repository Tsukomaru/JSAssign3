            <h2>Kyoto, Japan</h2>

            <p>In Kyoto, tradition hums in every alley and temple courtyard. You can wander beneath endless arcs of vermilion torii at Fushimi Inari, sip matcha in ancient teahouses, and witness how centuries-old rituals live alongside some of the most advanced technologies on Earth. Riding the bullet train at nearly 200 miles an hour, you’ll feel the future streak past fields where farmers still honor the old ways.</p>
            <p>I dream of stepping inside a <strong>machiya</strong>—those flexible wooden townhouses designed to bend but not break. Soaking in a mountain onsen, the steam rising like prayer, I would finally understand how Kyoto makes even time itself feel soft at the edges.</p>

        <p>In London, the shopping districts flash like polished jewels, and the streets hum with history beneath your boots. Bond Street gleams with old-world luxury; Camden thrums with rebellious spirit. Here, every glance through a shop window or market stall is a meeting point of centuries and seconds.</p>
        <p>Watching supercars prowl the streets—Ferraris, McLarens, Bugattis—I would remember the videos I grew up admiring. I used to dream of standing on those same curbs, hearing the low growl of engines echo off stone buildings older than my country.</p>

            <p>Paris is a city stitched together by romance. Morning light catches on café tables and stone balconies; the smell of baking bread spills into every crooked street. Living in a classic French apartment—even for a little while—would feel like living inside a song, with wooden floors that creak under history’s weight and windows that open onto streets that have seen revolutions and poems alike.</p>
            <p>Learning the language, sharing coffee with strangers, letting the city’s rhythm take hold—this is why I long to go. And when Paris has sung its song, I would board a train and let the rails carry me outward, toward new countries, new adventures, and the wide-open future waiting just beyond the horizon.</p>
