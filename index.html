        <h1>About Joseph Sabio</h1>
        <h2>From Collapse to Clarity</h2>
        <p>I used to think I had to be healed before I could create.  
            But I’ve learned that the creating is the healing.  
            This is my story—from survival to signal.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, I was homeless, sick, and scared.  
            I had SIBO, severe anxiety, and no stable place to call home.  
            My thoughts were racing, my body was in pain, and the future felt like a hallway with no doors.</p>
        <p>There were nights I slept on concrete, and mornings where hunger gnawed at my gut before the sun even rose.  
            It wasn’t just physical illness—I was mentally fried. The weight of failure, regret, and isolation felt heavier than the bags I carried.  
            I didn’t believe I had anything worth building.</p>
        <p>Then something cracked.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t cinematic.  
            It was quiet. One day, I opened the voice memos app and started talking to myself.  
            Journaling turned into rhyming. Rhyming turned into songs.  
            I wrote about the pain. About loss. About the fire still flickering under all that smoke.</p>
        <p>I started building systems and tools that helped me survive and grow:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Voice Memos + MacWhisper — to capture my thoughts and transcribe them without reliving the pain</li>
            <li>Notion AI in "Dojo Mode" — where I don’t let the AI do the work for me; instead, it challenges me with questions, helping me sharpen my own thinking</li>
            <li>VS Code + Python — where I wrote my first journal app and began turning chaos into structure</li>
            <li>Physical systems — like walks with a weighted vest, red light therapy, and strict digital boundaries</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Each tool became a thread in the net I was weaving to catch myself.</p>
        <p>Now I’m not healed—but I’m here.  
            I’m studying cybersecurity. I’m making music. I wear earplugs to protect my focus and write even when I’m exhausted.  
            I use AI to reflect, but only in "Dojo Mode"—no shortcuts, just sharpening.</p>
        <p> 
            I’ve learned how to show up for myself.  
            How to write even when I’m not okay.  
            How to forgive and live the silence.</p>
        <p>I don’t create to go viral. I create to stay sovereign.  
            This is how I hold onto myself.</p>
        <p>Creating isn’t what I do when I’m healed.  
            It’s how I heal.</p>
        <p>And I'm not done writing</p>
